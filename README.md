RPG game based on problems solving and rooms to pass. Made for final work of my programming II disciplin,in university. Objects orientation, texts and user interation and a little bit of humor.

About "DigitalVersatileDisc" class:
 - The file path is personal from each user of the code (a problem who i need to solve later).
 Then, it's necessary to made a few changes before you run it.
